		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			History of Global Refugee Migration illustrates major refugee migrations around the world since World War II. One purpose of this visualization is to provide viewers with an easily-digestible animation of major refugee migrations in order to give them a spatial understanding of events that they may be familiar with. The other purpose is to educate viewers on refugee migrations that they may not be familiar with, and provide them with the opportunity to learn more about specific events that they may be interested in.
		</p>
		<p>
			We hope that History of Refugee Migration is of use to anyone that is interested in major historical events over the past century or specifically in the many refugee migrations that have changed the transformed the world that live in.
		</p>
		<h2>Data</h2>
		<p>
			The data used for History of Refugee Migration was extracted from a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/world/historical-migrant-crisis/">Washington Post article</a> that takes its own unique spin at illustrating refugee migration events over the past century.
